                    \nA cryptocurrency coin is a native currency on the blockchain, it is a medium of exchange and is also something that stores value. 
                    \nThis is used to purchase goods and services as well as something that could be used to exchange for something else like fiat currency. 
                    \nTokens are not so similar, they are digital assets but they don&apos;t have their own blockchain. They operate on the crypto coins blockchain like Ethereum; like Dai and Tether.Â  
                    \nAs coins rely on the blockchain itself, tokens need smart contracts which are arrays of code that expedite trades and payments of the users. Crypto tokens like cryptocurrency can also be used to hold value and be exchanged but they can also be used to represent physical assets , utility, services or even other digital assets. They are also used as a governance mechanism for voting on the upgrades and future decisions of specific protocols.
                    \nCrypto coins and tokens are both digital assets ; coins can be used to allow individuals to make payments with their own currency whereas tokens can be used for many other purposes.`}

              A crypto wallet is where users can keep their private keys and passwords to gain access to their cryptocurrencies. 
              \nWallets can come in several forms such as Hardware wallets(ledger, usb stick), or mobile apps like coinbase. Crypto wallets are crucial to anyone that owns crypto currency. 
              \nUnlike regular wallets, crypto wallets do not store your crypto, which is live on the blockchain; however it keeps your private keys that provide the proof of ownership that users have on the crypto. 
              \nIf the users lose their private keys then they lose access to their crypto, so keep your wallet secure!
