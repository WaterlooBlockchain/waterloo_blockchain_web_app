                  <div class="blog_content">
                  Cryptocurrency coins and tokens are both considered digital assets as they are both non tangible assets that are created and traded and stored in digital format.
                    A cryptocurrency coin is a native currency on the blockchain, it is a medium of exchange and is also something that stores value. 
                   
                    This is used to purchase goods and services as well as something that could be used to exchange for something else like fiat currency. 
                   
                    Tokens are not so similar, they are digital assets but they don&apos;t have their own blockchain. They operate on the crypto coins blockchain like Ethereum; like Dai and Tether.Â  
                   
                    As coins rely on the blockchain itself, tokens need smart contracts which are arrays of code that expedite trades and payments of the users. Crypto tokens like cryptocurrency can also be used to hold value and be exchanged but they can also be used to represent physical assets , utility, services or even other digital assets. They are also used as a governance mechanism for voting on the upgrades and future decisions of specific protocols.
                  
                    Crypto coins and tokens are both digital assets; coins can be used to allow individuals to make payments with their own currency whereas tokens can be used for many other purposes.

                Web 2.0 developed the growth of user-generated content along with its compatibility and usability for users. Web 3.0 is built on the concept of decentralization which refers to a system where control is transferred from a central authority to a distributed network.
               
                In Web 3.0, decentralized apps are run on the blockchain and the apps allow users to participate without giving up their data.'
